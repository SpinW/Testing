# Create an image with enough dependencies to support a mounted-in matlab.
#
# These expect you to define some local information:
# - `MATLAB_ROOT` is your matlab installation on the Docker host, perhaps `/usr/local/MATLAB/R2016a`.
# - `MATLAB_LOGS` is optional path on the Docker host to receive Matlab logs, perhaps `~/matlab-logs`.
# - `MATLAB_MAC_ADDRESS` is the MAC address associated with your own Matlab License, of the form `00:00:00:00:00:00`.

# Inspired from Mike Bartoli's docker-matlab code, https://github.com/mbartoli/docker-matlab.git
